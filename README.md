# Gym Management System

The Gym Management System is a comprehensive application developed as the final project for the Programming 3 course. It provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing gym-related activities, such as member management, trainer management, workout plan creation, and daily workout tracking.
## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language used for the backend development.
- Spring Boot: Framework used to build the application and handle the RESTful API.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store the gym management data.
- HTML/CSS: Used for the frontend interface of the application.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web pages.

## Features

- Members: Allows managing gym members, including adding new members and listing all members.
- Trainers: Provides functionalities to handle trainers, such as adding new trainers and viewing all trainers.
- Workout Plans: Allows creating and managing workout plans, including adding exercises, editing, and deleting plans.
- Daily Workouts: Enables users to view and manage daily workout details, including adding exercises and updating the workout information.

## Project Details

This Gym Management System implements several important concepts and principles, including:

- SOLID Principles: The code follows SOLID principles to ensure a modular and maintainable design.
- CRUD Operations: The system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing members, trainers, workout plans, and daily workouts.
- Design Patterns:
  - Singleton: The Singleton design pattern is used in the GymLogger utility class, which reports system activities such as object creation, updates, and removals.
  - Prototype: The Prototype pattern is implemented to create cloned instances of exercises when editing them in the daily workout.
  - Strategy: The Strategy pattern is used to provide different workout strategies for different workout plans.

I want to highlight that this project was developed as part of a college assignment, even though we hadn't covered web development and database management concepts in our curriculum yet. However, I took the initiative to study and apply these concepts on my own, and I'm pleased to say that the project turned out to be successful.

Please note that this project is intended for demonstration purposes and customization should be done with caution to preserve its original functionality and design.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the functionalities of the Gym Management System!
